## Make and release a video game

### Overview

This is a pretty broad goal, but I'm looking for a game of a higher than
'gamejam' standard, something actually fully playable and releasable as a
complete game.

A success here might be 'have someone you don't know pay for your game', but
even just 'release something you're not unhappy with' is a good target.
