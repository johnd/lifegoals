## Post three complete cinematic FPV flight videos to YouTube

### Overview

The goal here represents being able to do a range of things with the FPV drone
both consistently and across a range of locations/styles, so that I'm able to
post three good quality 'cinematic' style flight videos. These don't necessarily
need to be 'level 5' difficulty, but should include at least basic FPV skills
and be well edited, set to music, etc. Either dive/flippy freestyle videos or
close-in narrow gaps and swooping around building interior style videos are
acceptable (or any mix of those).

The goal being posting a video means that done needs to have a decent enough
camera for this. A Mobula7 HD would be about the lowest quality acceptable.
