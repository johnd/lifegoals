## Post a video on YouTube of a drone dive of a tall (8+ floors) building

### Overview

This is probably the least set of my goals so far: my overall goal is 'get good
at FPV', but I ned something more concrete for this list. Once I'm able to
practice outside, I may change this to being able to hit a specific gap or some
other goal.

The goal being posting a video means that done needs to have a decent enough
camera for this. A Mobula7 HD would be about the lowest quality acceptable.
