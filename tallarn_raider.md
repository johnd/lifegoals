## Finish painting the Tallarn Desert Raider mini from the '90s

### Overview

This is an original 1990s Games Workshop Imperial Guard Tallarn Desert Raiders
Lieutenant model which I bought when I was about 13 or 14 and half finished
painting.

It should still be in my boxes of random GW stuff, and I can either finish the
paint job or strip it and start again. If I'm not able to find it, I can get one
off eBay for Â£7-10.

This should be completed to a higher than 'table ready' standard, but I don't
need to be winning any awards for it. Good enough for me is good enough.
