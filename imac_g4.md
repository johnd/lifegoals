## Convert an iMac G4 to run modern hardware

### Overview

Put something like an M1 MacMini inside an iMac G4 case, like [this guy on

The second version makes swapping out the screen look relatively straightforward
previous attempts at this I've seen either did a horrible job of this or made it
look near impossible.
