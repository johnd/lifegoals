## Lift an atlas stone

### Overview

This would require 6 to 12 months of weight training, which I am (as of writing)
not in a state of health or fitness to even start.

Stones are fairly easy to get online, but a bit expensive and shipping is
costly. Practice stones exist - metal coated in rubber or beanbags filled with
steel shot - and while they'd be good for practising, don't count as filling
this goal.

The exact weight of stone can be determined later, but I *expect* something like
lifting a 120kg stone onto a four foot tall platform or over a four foot tall
bar would count.
