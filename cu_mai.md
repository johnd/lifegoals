## Make a Cu Mai axe

### Overview

Cu Mai is an advanced forging technique that involves layers of steel and copper
being forged into a single ingot, which can then be used to make other things.

Specifically, I would like to make a single-handed axe using this technique.
This is a very ambitious goal, and I've not been able to find any examples of
other people doing this. It's possible that as I develop the skills required
I'll realise that it's actually impractical, in which case this goal can devolve
to making a set of Cu Mai steak knifes, which is definitely possible.
