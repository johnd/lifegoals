I'm keeping a list of things I'd like to achieve in my life. It's not quite what
you'd think of as a 'bucket list', which is typically things like 'go skydiving'
or 'visit Rome', it's - mostly - more aspirational, things that I want to learn
how to do, or improve myself to be *able* to do.

Over time I'll achieve some of these goals and add new ones, or possibly
rework/change existing goals as I learn more about the subject.

The purpose of this site is just to give me a place to track my progress on each
goal, what I'm doing to work towards the goal, and so on.
