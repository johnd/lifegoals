This goal is probably going to take the longest of all of them, since I can't
even begin to start while we're living at our current house!

Doing any kind of knife/axe-making requires a bunch of fairly specialist tools,
like a forge, grinding belts, an anvil, and for exotic materials like damascus,
san mai, go mai, and cu mai, you really need a hydraulic press and/or a power
hammer.

These things are pretty much all expensive, bulky, loud, and fairly dangerous.
It's not really something I can kick off in my home office or my balcony.

Having workshop space is one of the requirements we're keeping in mind for
when we move, but for various reasons it's entirely unclear when we'll actually
be able to move.
