I [did a poll on Twitter](https://twitter.com/semanticist/status/1450395204540944384) and they picked Swedish, so I guess that's what I'll be learning, then.

Probably next week or the week after, I'll switch my Duo Lingo from Klingon
(which I was trying to learn before the pandemic, without much enthusiasm) to
Swedish and start using it daily.
