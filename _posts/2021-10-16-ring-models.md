title: Sources for 3d models for ring
---

There's plug-ins for Blender which are designed to help make 3d models of
jewellery specifically for casting, but there's a pretty steep learning curve
there (first for Blender and then for the plug-in - not to mention the actual
design part!), so maybe for a first pass at this I want to use an existing model
someone else has made?

I've had some luck with resin prints of [this 'low poly' ring](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:711970),
although it would take some tweaking to get the scaling to work correctly for
E's ring.

It so happens that I do have a fairly long tutorial on learning Blender by
making low poly models, so that might be useful if I wanted to make a custom
version?

Alternatively, if I had a specific idea and wanted a good model to work from, I
could find someone on Fiverr (or similar) and commission a piece?
