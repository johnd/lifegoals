title: General health and fitness limits

This was one of the first 'life goals' that I really considered and I've talked
about it on Twitter ages ago. Someone who is much more experienced in weight
training than me suggested that any reasonably healthy/fit person under 50
should be able to work up to lifting an Atlas Stone in about 12 to 18 months
(IIRC).

Unfortunately, I am neither reasonably fit nor healthy, so that's going to be a
major limiting factor on being able to really start on this. (It's also going to
impact other goals in various ways.)

I'm not going to track my "weight loss journey" (boak) here, but I might post
updates if I reach what I feel is a significant milestone on my way to being
able to *start* weight training.
