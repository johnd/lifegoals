After finally getting a wee charging station set up, and figuring out a bit
better on how to set up my radio, I was all set to start flying my [Happymodel
Mobula 7 HD](http://www.happymodel.cn/index.php/2019/02/14/mobula7-hd-2-3s-compatible-brushless-hdwhoop-cinewhoop/)
tomorrow...

...except that one of the motors appears to be dead. A quick and dirty test
suggests that the ESC isn't even doing its initial 'I'm awake' noise through it,
so either one of the ESCs on the 'All In One' board is toast, or more likely the
motor itself is dead.

This is a brand new quad that's never seen the air, and also my first real
attempt to fly an FPV quad, so I'm not super comfortable with fiddling with it
and replacing parts, so back to the retail it's going to have to go.

Very frustrating, since I was intending to start flying a battery pack every
lunch time from tomorrow. I figured with that plus some time at the weekend I
could get to 10+ hours of flight time before the end of the year, but now I
don't know when I'll be able to start.

I do have an [iFlight Green Hornet](https://shop.iflight-rc.com/iflight-quads-cat25/green-hornet-v3-cinewhoop-bnf-pro1488)
(that's the current v3 model, mine is the original), but I only have a couple of
batteries for it and it's *a lot* bigger, noisier, and scarier. I'd intended to
start learning FPV on a smaller, more small-indoor-space-friendly quad, and
while the Green Hornet is small by race/freestlye quad standards, it's still a
bit big to be bouncing around my wee house in.

If it looks like it'll be a long delay before getting a replacement for my
Mobula 7, I might have to just start with the Green Hornet and hope that I don't
murder any of the cats with it.
