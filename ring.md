## Make my own wedding ring.

### Overview

Yes, we have rings from our actual wedding, but that was a long time ago and
we've grown as people since then, so I'd like to make new ones that actually
fit.

This goal includes designing or adapting an existing 3d model, 3d printing it,
doing all the prep and casting it in metal. Ideally I'd like to cast it in
silver or another precious metal, but if I've used silicone bronze and I'm
wearing it, then it counts.
